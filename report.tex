\section{Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF)}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone\_multi-frequency\_signaling}{Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling} is a procedure to encode symbols using an audio signal.
The possible symbols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, *, \#, A, B, C, and D.
A symbol is represented by a sum of cosine waves: for $t=0,1,\dots, T-1$,

$$
y_t = \cos(2\pi f_1 t/f_s) + \cos(2\pi f_2 t/f_s)
$$
where each combination of $(f_1, f_2)$ represents a symbols.
The first frequency has four different levels (low frequencies), and the second frequency has four other levels (high frequencies); there are 16 possible combinations.
In the notebook, you can find an example symbol sequence encoded with sound and corrupted by noise (white noise and a distorted sound).

\begin{exercise}
Design a procedure that takes a sound signal as input and outputs the sequence of symbols. 
To that end, you can use the provided training set.
The signals have a varying number of symbols with a varying duration. 
There is a brief silence between each symbol.

Describe in 5 to 10 lines your methodology and the calibration procedure (give the hyperparameter values). Hint: use the time-frequency representation of the signals, apply a change-point detection algorithm to find the starts and ends of the symbols and silences, and then classify each segment. 

\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
What are the two symbolic sequences encoded in the test set?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sequence 1:
        \item Sequence 2:
    \end{itemize}

\section{Wavelet transform for graph signals}
Let $G$ be a graph defined a set of $n$ nodes $V$ and a set of edges $E$. A specific node is denoted by $v$ and a specific edge, by $e$.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian $L$ are $\lambda_1\leq\lambda_2\leq\dots\leq \lambda_n$ and $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots, $u_n$ respectively.

For a signal $f\in\RR^{n}$, the Graph Wavelet Transform (GWT) of $f$ is $ W_f: \{1,\dots,M\}\times V \longrightarrow \RR$:
\begin{equation}
    W_f(m, v) := \sum_{l=1}^n \hat{g}_m(\lambda_l)\hat{f}_l u_l(v)
\end{equation}
where $\hat{f}= [\hat{f}_1,\dots,\hat{f}_n]$ is the Fourier transform of $f$ and $\hat{g}_m$ are $M$ kernel functions.
The number $M$ of scales is a user-defined parameter and is set to $M:=9$ in the following.
Several designs are available for the $\hat{g}_m$; here, we use the Spectrum Adapted Graph Wavelets (SAGW).
Formally, each kernel $\hat{g}_m$ is such that
\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}_m(\lambda) := \hat{g}^U(\lambda - am) \quad (0\leq\lambda\leq\lambda_n)
\end{equation}
where $a:=\lambda_n / (M+1-R)$,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}^U(\lambda) := \frac{1}{2}\left[ 1 + \cos\left( 2\pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{a R}  + \frac{1}{2} \right)\right) \right]\one(-Ra \leq \lambda < 0)
\end{equation}
and $R>0$ is defined by the user.

\begin{exercise}
Plot the kernel functions $\hat{g}_m$ for $R=1$, $R=3$ and $R=5$ (take $\lambda_n=12$) on Figure~\ref{fig:sagw-kernels}. What is the influence of $R$?
\end{exercise}

\newpage
We will study the Molene data set (the one we used in the last tutorial).
The signal is the temperature.

\begin{exercise}
Construct the graph using the distance matrix and exponential smoothing (use the median heuristics for the bandwidth parameter). 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove all stations with missing values in the temperature.
    \item Choose the minimum threshold so that the network is connected and the average degree is at least 3.
    \item What is the time where the signal is the least smooth?
    \item What is the time where the signal is the smoothest?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The stations with missing values are\dots

The threshold is equal to \dots.

The signal is the least smooth at\dots

The signal is the smoothest at\dots

\end{solution}

\newpage
\begin{exercise}
(For the remainder, set $R=3$ for all wavelet transforms.)

For each node $v$, the vector $[W_f(1, v), W_f(2, v),\dots, W_f(M, v)]$ can be used as a vector of features. We can for instance classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a node is considered low frequency if the scales $m\in\{1,2,3\}$ contain most of the energy,
    \item a node is considered medium frequency if the scales $m\in\{4,5,6\}$ contain most of the energy,
    \item a node is considered high frequency if the scales $m\in\{6,7,9\}$ contain most of the energy.
\end{itemize}


For both signals from the previous question (smoothest and least smooth) as well as the first available timestamp, apply this procedure and display on the map the result (one colour per class).

\begin{exercise}
Display the average temperature and for each timestamp, adapt the marker colour to the majority class present in the graph (see notebook for more details).

\end{figure}
\end{solution}

\newpage
\begin{exercise}
The previous graph $G$ only uses spatial information.
To take into account the temporal dynamic, we construct a larger graph $H$ as follows: a node is now \textit{a station at a particular time} and is connected to neighbouring stations (with respect to $G$) and to itself at the previous timestamp and the following timestamp.
Notice that the new spatio-temporal graph $H$ is the Cartesian product of the spatial graph $G$ and the temporal graph $G'$ (which is simply a line graph, without loop).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Express the Laplacian of $H$ using the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$ (use Kronecker products).
    \item Express the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $H$ using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian of $G$ and $G'$.
    \item Compute the wavelet transform of the temperature signal.
    \item Classify nodes into low/medium/high frequency and display the same figure as in the previous question.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
